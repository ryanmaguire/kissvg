## A Friendly Warning
**This project will not currently compile.** I am tearing it apart and moving
a lot of code to my other project, libtmpl, which is a simple library for
various mathematical computations. I had a lot of repeat code spread across
several projects, and I am now attempting to centralize and clean it all up.

# KissVG
KissVG is a simple vector graphics library (Keep It Simple, Stupid - Vector
Graphics) written in C89/C90 compliant code, generally aimed at making
mathematical figures. It includes tools for Euclidean, hyperbolic, and
spherical geometry, as well as basic plotting. It uses the cairo graphics
library as a backend for producing the files (PDF, PS, or SVG).
